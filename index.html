            I can be described that bites of more than he can chew, metaphorically and literally! It is better to be a
            moderately
            large fish in a big pond than a goldfish in a fishbowl. It is this mentality that got me though my
            undergraduate and
            graduate years. I would also like to thank all people who gave me free food! I couldn't have done it
            without you.

            My name is John Niedfeldt, and that is pronounced "Need-felt". I cannot tell you how many times people have
            mispronounced
            my name. Recently, I even considered changing my last name, though I have a hard time thinking what name I
            should grace with
            my association. Maybe Smith? Except for the fact that everyone would associate me with the default form
            text on the internet,
            or Pocahontas' lover in the Disney movie, it would be great!
        </p>

            My free time is spent hanging out with friends, watching movies, binging Netflix, reading books, playing
            Ultimate (when I can
            find people to play with), keeping up on the newest technologies, programming in Python or other
            programming languages, or
            having deep discussions with my close friends. I also just switched careers and am now a Software Developer
            for a cyber
            security startup called Avirtek. I have no idea where I am going to be in 10 years, but I know that the
            journey will be an
            adventure of epic proportions, and I am the captain of my fate.
